A major Cloudflare outage recently brought down a significant portion of the internet, affecting countless websites and services. The incident highlights the critical role that infrastructure providers like Cloudflare play in the digital ecosystem.

The outage was caused by a configuration error during a routine update, leading to a cascading failure across their network. While the issue was resolved relatively quickly, it served as a stark reminder of the internet's fragility.

For businesses, this event underscores the importance of redundancy and having a multi-CDN strategy. Relying on a single provider, no matter how reliable, introduces a single point of failure that can have widespread consequences.
